# Snip-it!

Hi, Snip-it is another yet URL-shortener written with the MERN stack.
Following the needs of this use case, I choose the unique id approach, the package nanoid provides a low probability of data collision with an id with  9 or higher characters.
MongoDB seemed also a suitable choice given the mobility provided by the Documents and the Vertical scalability of NoSQL solutions.
